# 💼 Credit Risk EDA & ❤️ Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

This repository contains two real-world data science projects that apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques to domains like **finance** and **healthcare**.

---

## 📌 Project 1: Credit Risk Exploratory Data Analysis

### 🔍 Objective:
To explore a credit application dataset and uncover patterns that help predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### 📊 Key Insights:
- Around 8% of applicants were defaulters
- Age group 30–45 had a higher default rate
- Risk was higher for people with low income and unstable jobs

## ❤️ Project 2: Predicting Heart Failure Mortality

### 🔍 Objective:
To predict whether a heart failure patient is at risk of mortality based on clinical attributes.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance

### ✅ Results:
- Random Forest achieved over 90% accuracy
- Most influential features: Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction, Age
