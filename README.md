# 💼 Credit Risk Analysis & ❤️ Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

This repository contains two data-driven projects focused on applying **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** to solve real-world problems in the **finance** and **healthcare** sectors. Both projects involve hands-on data exploration, visualization, and actionable insights.

---

## 📊 Project 1: Credit Risk EDA

### 🧩 Objective:
To explore customer credit application data and discover patterns that help in understanding **loan default risks**.

### 📈 Key Tasks:
- Cleaned and prepared large tabular data
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
- Identified patterns based on features like **age**, **income**, **education**, and **occupation**
- Used plots to visualize default rates across segments

### 🧠 Key Insights:
- Around **8% of applicants** were defaulters
- Highest default risk in **age group 30–45**
- Customers with **lower income**, **unstable jobs**, and **lower education levels** were more likely to default

### 🔧 Tools:
Python • Pandas • Seaborn • Matplotlib • Plotly

## ❤️ Project 2: Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

### 🧩 Objective:
To predict whether a patient with heart failure is likely to **survive or die** based on clinical attributes.

### 📈 Key Tasks:
- Analyzed patient data for key features like **age**, **serum creatinine**, and **ejection fraction**
- Applied classification models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **F1-score**

### 🧠 Key Findings:
- **Random Forest** gave the best results with over **90% accuracy**
- Top predictors of mortality: **serum creatinine**, **ejection fraction**, and **age**

### 🔧 Tools:
Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Seaborn • Matplotlib
